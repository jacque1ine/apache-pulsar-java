# JWT Token 
The pipeline and config map in this folder demonstrate how to use a JWT token for authentication. Note that the authParamMap cannot be used, because the AuthenticationToken class does not have a constructor that accepts a Map or multiple parameters. Therefore, the authParams for this class must be provided as a single String. Although the admin and client configuration files reference different service URLs, they can still rely on the same token.
